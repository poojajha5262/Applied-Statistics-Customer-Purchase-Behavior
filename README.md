# Purchasing Behavior of Customers using Applied-Statistics

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA). By leveraging these statistical techniques, we aimed to uncover insights that could inform marketing strategies and improve offer acceptance rates.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: We obtained a dataset containing customer information and purchasing behavior.

Descriptive Statistics Analysis: We performed descriptive statistics analysis to summarize key features of the dataset, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, we visualized and explored the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations between variables related to customer behavior.

Insights and Recommendations: Based on our analysis, we derived actionable insights and recommendations to optimize marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates.

Findings:

Descriptive statistics provided insights into the distribution of variables such as purchase frequency, amount spent, and customer demographics.
EDA revealed correlations between customer attributes and purchasing behavior, identifying potential target segments for marketing campaigns.
Conclusion:

By applying descriptive statistics and EDA techniques, we gained valuable insights into customer purchase behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance marketing strategies and improve business outcomes.
